fixes:
  - >
    Fixed a bug in the EC reconstructor where an unsuccessful sync
    would cause extra disk I/O load on the remote server. Now the extra
    checking work is only requested if the sync request was successful.

  - >
    PUT subrequests generated from a client-side COPY will now properly log
    the SSC (server-side copy) Swift source field. See
    https://docs.openstack.org/developer/swift/logs.html#swift-source for
    more information.

  - >
    Fixed error where a container drive error resulted in double space
    usage on rest drives. When drive with container or account database
    is unmounted, the bug would create handoff replicas on all remaining
    drives, increasing the drive space used and filling the cluster.

  - Fixed some minor test compatibility issues.

  - Updated docs to reference appropriate ports.
