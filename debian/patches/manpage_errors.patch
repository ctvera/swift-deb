 Lists and optionally kills orphaned Swift processes. This is done by scanning
-/var/run/swift or the directory specified to the -r switch for .pid files and
+/var/run/swift or the directory specified to the \-r switch for .pid files and
 listing any processes that look like Swift processes but aren't associated with
 the pids in those .pid files. Any Swift processes running with the 'once'
 parameter are ignored, as those are usually for full-speed audit scans and
 such.
